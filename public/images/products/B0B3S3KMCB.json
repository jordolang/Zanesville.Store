    "description": "When shoes have a tendency to accumulate, one pair kicked inside the door quickly turns into several, which in no time snowballs into a physical barrier to your entryway and hallway, not to mention an immediate aesthetic affront to your home's decor.\nDikolre bamboo shoe rack is the perfect storage organizer for dress shoes, sneakers, flip-flops, high-heeled shoes, and slippers. Instead of having your shoes jumbled up underneath a bed or cluttering up in the bottom of a closet, a small space-saver shoe rack keeps your footwear safely stored and easily accessible.\nDikolre free-standing shoe rack with a compact, lightweight design, you can easily move the rack anywhere you need instant shoe storage.\nOtherwise, our Dikolre bamboo shoe rack with its classic and simple design meshes with most home decors, making it just an idea of a home for winter boots as well as summer sandals.\nFeaturing a stackable design, the shelves can be stacked on top of each other to save space. You can also integrate the rack with similar racks to create a vertical storage system.\nProvides efficient space-saving storage in any space, such as the entryway, closet, study room, office room, living room, bathroom, kitchen, hallway, bedroom, balcony, dormitory, etc. With a compact and lightweight design, this bamboo shoe rack will not take up too much room wherever you want to use it. Easy to assemble, this free-standing shoe rack comes with clear instructions and all the necessary hardware.",
    "bullet_points": "• SOLID BAMBOO: Bamboo is stronger than wood and will last longer. Thus, we choose renewable resource bamboo that grows in natural alpine areas. The texture is strong load-bearing and stable. Each layer of the free standing shoe racks has a high load-bearing capacity. After the product is carbonized at a high temperature, it is waterproof and not easy to crack and deform.\n• EASY TO ASSEMBLE: We have upgraded the connection method of the shoe holder and no longer used plastic connectors to connect it, which greatly increases the stability of the shoe storage and avoids bending in the middle of the shoe rack. And the assembly process of the shoe shelf is simple and easy to understand, and everything needed will be included, so there is no need to search for tools. We will also include an installation tutorial for the small shoe rack for reference.\n• WIDE RANGE OF USES：Undoubtedly, this small shoe rack for entryway small space will keep your shoes in order. In addition, this shoe stand also has many other functions. It can be used as a bookshelf or flower rack in the living room or bedroom, as well as a towel rack in the bathroom, or even a small box for holding handicrafts, or anywhere you need to store things.\n• STACKABLE DESIGN: Whenever trying to save space or make room, we find ourselves stacking things on top of the other. This organization and storage shelf was designed with perfect tenon design without stacking tools. As you see the top shelf has a little protrusion that allows for stacking. The shoe racks are connected by embedding grooves between the upper and lower frames. You can stack them to save space in the room while gaining additional storage.\n• QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE: Thank you for choosing our product, you didn't just get a great vertical shoe rack--you also supported our growth, which is pretty cool(at least we think so). We have always cherished every customer who trusts us. We hope your shopping experience is better than ever before, and we are standing by to help you if you have any problems! To make you satisfied is our developing goal!",
