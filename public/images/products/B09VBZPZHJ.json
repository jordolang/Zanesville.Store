    "bullet_points": "• Important Notice: This Is Not an Air Conditioner This product is an air curtain, also known as an air door. It only provides the function of blowing air to create a barrier and does not have any cooling or heating capabilities. Please do not purchase this item if you are looking for air conditioning functionality.\n• 【Multiple Control Methods for Smart & Convenient Use】Equipped with a magnetic door switch, remote control, and manual buttons on the unit, this air curtain offers flexible control options. The magnetic switch automatically activates the fan when the door opens, helping improve energy efficiency and convenience. Whether you're at home or managing a business, these smart controls ensure seamless operation whenever you need it.\n• 【Dual-Speed Performance for Maximum Flexibility】This air curtain features two adjustable speed settings to suit different environments. On high speed, it delivers up to 2559 FPM airflow and 1527 CFM air volume, effectively blocking up to 90% of insects like mosquitoes and flies. Low speed mode (2165 FPM, 1292 CFM) is ideal for quieter spaces or energy-saving use. Easily switch between speeds using the included remote control or the buttons on the unit. Noise level remains low at just 60 dB.\n• 【Powerful Air Barrier for Enhanced Indoor Comfort】Our air curtain creates a strong, invisible air barrier that keeps bugs, dirt, and outdoor pollutants outside while helping maintain stable indoor temperatures. It improves comfort and hygiene by reducing airborne contaminants. Perfect for both home and commercial use — ideal for kitchens, garages, salons, barbershops, conference halls, backyards, and any space where frequent door openings cause discomfort, energy loss, or cleanliness issues.\n• 【Easy Installation with Lifelong Technical Support】Installation is simple and hassle-free — just mount the bracket above your door frame, hang the air curtain onto the bracket, and connect the magnetic door switch sensors to the top and bottom of the door. If you encounter any difficulties during installation, our team is ready to assist. We offer 24-hour customer support and lifelong technical guidance to ensure you get the most out of your purchase.",
