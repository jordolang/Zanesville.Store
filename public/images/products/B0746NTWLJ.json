    "description": "Stay tangle free with our cordless light filtering roller shades! Snap N' Glide operating mechanism ensures that the shade gently rolls up and smoothly glides back down. Modern and sleek design is a great fit for bedrooms, living rooms, home offices, and more.\nTug on the pull cord to lower your shades. Pull down on the shade again to trigger the mechanism and it will automatically glide back up by itself.\nTwo-way mount allows you to choose the best fit for your windows. Fabric curls into a neat compact roll when fully raised and won't block your view.\nHigh quality light filtering fabric helps protect against harsh glare and UV rays. Blocks intense heat when pulled all the way down.\nThese shades are an ideal choice for larger windows, offering a clean and polished appearance.\nAre these shades machine washable?\nNo, we only recommend light spot cleaning with a damp cloth. Avoid using any harsh soaps or detergents that may damage the fabric.\nCan these be an outside or ceiling mount?\nYes, these can be mounted inside the window frame, outside the window frame, or to the ceiling. The instructions include directions for each mounting style and the included brackets are designed to be used for either.\nIs a valance included?\nNo, they are standard roller shades.\nCan people see through these from the outside?\nNo, this provides privacy.\nCan the shade be shortened in length?\nIt can be used at shorter heights by just pulling down to where it is needed.\nWe believe window blinds and shades are more than just functional necessities. Every window tells a story, and our products are part of that narrative.\nWith a focus on affordability, innovation, and ease of installation, we have revolutionized window treatments to suit the modern lifestyle.\nEffortlessly make your home a place as chic as you are.",
