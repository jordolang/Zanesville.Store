    "description": "At SUPER LINER, we understand that your Tesla is more than just a car—it’s an extension of your lifestyle, a symbol of your pursuit of innovation, sustainability, and excellence. Every Tesla carries your dreams and adventures, and our purpose is to provide the most reliable protection for your vehicle, ensuring every drive is safer, cleaner, and more enjoyable.\nTrusted by 100,000+ Tesla Owners – Our floor mats are the top choice for Tesla drivers who demand perfect fit and superior protection.\nSafe for Families – Crafted from 100% recyclable TPE material, our mats are odor-free, non-toxic, and safe for children and pets.\nDesigned for Real Life, Tested for Extreme Conditions – Our mats withstand temperatures from -40°F to 122°F, ensuring year-round protection against rain, snow, mud, and spills.\nJoin SUPER LINER! Choose premium protection for your Tesla and elevate your driving experience—because your car deserves the best.\nIntroducing our premium TPE automotive floor mats, thoughtfully designed for both performance and the environment.\nDebris-channeling grooves automatically trap dirt beneath shoes, reducing cabin mess and maintaining cleaner footwells.\nNon-slip studs and reinforced ribs lock mats in place while resisting deformation for long-lasting vehicle protection.\nDesigned for all weather conditions, SUPER LINER TPE Floor Mats provide robust protection against rain, snow, mud, and spills. With deep channels and raised edges, these mats effectively contain liquids, preventing them from seeping into your car’s carpet and causing damage.\nOur floor mats require no fixing or adhesives—simply place them in your car for instant installation. They can be easily removed when needed. The anti-slip design on the back ensures they stay in place without shifting.\nCleaning SUPER LINER mats is a breeze. The TPE material is stain-resistant, allowing you to wipe off dirt and spills with a damp cloth or sponge. Unlike traditional fabric mats, there's no need for removal and laundering, saving you valuable time and effort.\nSUPER LINER TPE Tesla Floor Mats are not only user-friendly but also made from recyclable materials. This choice reflects our commitment to reducing the environmental impact of automotive accessories while providing sustainable solutions for car owners.\nTPE floor mats ensure health safety for families, kids, and pets\nWhy is there a bulge in the middle of the trunk liner?\nThe bulge is caused by the packaging process, which may temporarily deform the product. To resolve this, simply flatten the liner by placing a heavy object (e.g., books or boxes) on the affected area for 12+ hours.\nWhy does the trunk liner feel different in quality compared to the front and second-row mats?--1\nWhile all mats are made from durable TPE material, the trunk liner uses vacuum-forming technology to reduce shipping costs and ensure affordability.\nWhy does the trunk liner feel different in quality compared to the front and second-row mats?--2\nSome others use vacuum-forming for all mats, but we prioritize tailored designs: the front mats use advanced molding techniques for a perfect fit and durability, while the trunk liner’s vacuum-formed design balances cost-efficiency and functionality.\nWhat are the drawbacks of vacuum-forming?--1\nVacuum-formed mats are softer and lighter, but the edges may curl slightly or have minor uneven cuts. For front/second-row mats, these imperfections could leave gaps where dirt might accumulate.\nWhat are the drawbacks of vacuum-forming?--2\nHowever, trunk liners are less prone to this issue since they aren’t exposed to shoes for a long time. We reserve vacuum-forming for trunk liners to optimize cost and performance.",
