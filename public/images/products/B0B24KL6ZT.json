    "bullet_points": "• How to Choose a Proper Size: For INSIDE mount: Choose the size SAME or CLOSEST to your window width. For Example, if your windows are 30\" wide, order 30\" or slightly less for internal installation. For OUTSIDE mount: We recommend Shades Width=your window width + (3-5)inch for better coverage. For Example, if your windows width is 30\", order size 34\" would be okay for outside mount. Shades height can adjust from 0\" to 64\".\n• Light Filtering: Premium soft non-woven polyester fabric provide privacy while allowing a soft light into the room. Perfect for living room, family room, bedroom, bathroom.\n• Cordless Blinds for Windows: The cord-free design provides a clean, tangle-free look to the window and creates a safer environment for children and pets. Easy to raise up or lower down to control sunlight.\n• Sound & Heat Insulation: Non-sagging 3/5'' cell structure not only provides a uniform appearance, but also insulate your home against outside thermal energy in summer and keeps outside cold away from your warm house in winter. Also, our cellular shades can reduce the noise from outside to provide you a better environment to work or sleep.\n• (Pls Note) For INSIDE mount, window frame should have at least 1 2/5” depth. We provide customized size services. If you have any issues or questions in the process of purchasing, installing or using, please feel free to email to us by Amazon message and we will respond to you within 24 hours.",
