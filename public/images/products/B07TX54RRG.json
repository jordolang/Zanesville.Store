    "description": "Complete your bedroom decor with the Madison Park Pansy 3 Piece Tufted Chenille Floral Duvet Cover Set. The shabby chic duvet cover features white cotton tufted chenille floral pattern on a warm grey background that creates a lovely contrast. The 2 matching shams mirror the design of the duvet cover to complete the farmhouse aesthetic. Machine washable for easy care, this tufted chenille duvet cover set offers a soft shabby chic look to elevate your bedroom decor. Button closures help secure a comforter insert within the duvet cover and inside ties in the corners help prevent it from shifting (insert is NOT included). Due to the nature of the chenille fabric, some shedding will occur naturally in the first 3-4 washes. Items in the set may come in a rolled or compressed packaging, which will need to be fluffed up or steam ironed before use to remove wrinkles.",
